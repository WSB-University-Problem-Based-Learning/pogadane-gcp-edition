# pogadane-gcp-edition

A cloud-native redesign of the "pogadane" project, rebuilt on the Google Cloud Platform to provide a scalable, serverless solution for audio/video transcription and analysis. This fork moves beyond a local-first approach to a microservices architecture, leveraging the power of GCP's AI and data services.
